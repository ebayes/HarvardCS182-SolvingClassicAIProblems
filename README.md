# Harvard CS182 (Artifical Intelligence) Psets :robot:
A repo with code for the three programming elements of problem sets for Harvard's CS182 course on Artificial Intelligence.

* **Pset0** is an implementation of the classic [travelling salesman problem]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem)  to figure out the time to travel between different metros stations in Boston. Practically, it uses a ["breadth first search"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search) to find the minimum distance between two vertices in an adjacency matrix graph. *(Grade: 4/5)* :briefcase:

* **Pset1** implements a [Markov decision process (MDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process), value Iteration and policy Iteration, and belief state updates for a [partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_Markov_decision_process). *(Grade: 4/7)* :full_moon_with_face:

* **Pset3** solves a well-known robotic control problem – landing a lunar agent on the surface of the moon – using reinforcement learning (RL). Practically, it uses the [Lunar Lander](https://gym.openai.com/envs/LunarLander-v2/) environment in [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) using [Q-learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning), a model-free RL algorithm. *(Grade: 5/6)* :rocket:
